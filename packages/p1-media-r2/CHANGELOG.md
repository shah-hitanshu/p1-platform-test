## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 74dda98: Adds a README to every published package. Each one rendered a blank page on npmjs.com, because
  no `README.md` existed in the package directory to be included in the tarball — npm renders the
  README from the published tarball, not from the source repository, so a private repo was never
  the cause.

  Also repoints every `repository` URL at `pantheon-systems/p1-platform` with the correct
  `directory`. They still referenced the pre-merge repositories (`puck-css-integration`,
  `collaborative-state-system`, `p1-media-r2`), so the "Repository" link on each npm page went
  nowhere. Adds a matching `homepage` for each package.

  No runtime code changes.
