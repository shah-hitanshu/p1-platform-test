Adds a `./registry-sync` subpath export exposing `syncComponentRegistry`, `extractDescriptors`, and `buildRegistryIndex` with no React dependency, so component-registry syncing can run outside the browser (e.g. a headless CI script). This is a behavior-preserving extraction: `useComponentRegistry`'s public API, deps, and browser behavior are unchanged — it now delegates to the same logic via the new module instead of an inline, module-private function.
