**[Fix]** Published pages are now cached instead of server-rendered on every request.

### What Changed

Both public routes shipped with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, which disables the response cache and forces a full server render — and a round trip to the content API — for every visitor, on content that is identical for all of them. The catch-all route additionally read `searchParams`, which opts a route out of caching permanently on its own.

Published pages no longer read the request query string, and the catch-all declares `generateStaticParams`, so responses now carry `s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate` and are cacheable by a CDN.

`loadRemoteDatasourceContext` now accepts `searchParams` as optional.

**A path with no published page is now a real 404.** It previously rendered the "this page doesn't exist yet" screen with a 200 status, which was harmless while every response was uncacheable. Now that the route is statically renderable, a 200 there means every URL a crawler probes becomes a cached response and an indexable page. The screen itself is unchanged — it moved to `app/not-found.tsx`, so it renders from the not-found boundary with a 404 status. A backend outage is deliberately *not* a 404: it renders a separate, uncacheable holding page, because 404ing live content over a transient blip would deindex it.

**Reads of published content moved into `@pantheon-systems/p1-next-sdk/server`** as `loadPublishedPage` and `loadRouteTemplateKeys`. They carry invariants that are easy to break by accident in a forked app — initialization awaited per read, misses distinguished from outages, prerendering aborted rather than baking an empty page into the build, and both reads memoized with React `cache()` so `generateMetadata` and the page body share one fetch instead of hitting Postgres twice. How a miss is *presented* stays in the app.

Initialization is likewise no longer pinned to a module-level promise in `createP1Handler` and `createP1Pages`. `ensureInitialized` clears its state on failure precisely so the next caller retries; awaiting a stored promise defeated that, so one transient failure at cold start left every later request awaiting a permanently rejected promise.

**Publishing a route template now invalidates the public catch-all segment.** Instance URLs that resolve by template fall-through alone (`/jedi/5` against `/jedi/:id`) have no store entry, so they cannot be enumerated and were never revalidated — they served pre-edit content until `revalidate` expired. `createP1Handler` accepts `publicPageSegment` for an app whose catch-all is not `[...puckPath]`.

### Caching and publish visibility

`revalidatePath` clears the Next.js response cache, so with no CDN in front an edit appears immediately — that invalidation was previously dead code, since there was never a cached response to invalidate. Behind a CDN that honors the advertised `s-maxage=300`, a publish takes up to 300s (plus `stale-while-revalidate`) to become visible, because nothing in this flow purges the CDN. Adding a purge hook to the publish path is what would close that window.

### Migration / Action Required

The `?param=` **query override** no longer applies to published pages. Route template params are unaffected — they come from the path, so `/products/hats` still resolves `{{ urlParams.slug }}` as before. Only overriding that value with `?slug=…` stops working, along with any datasource driven purely by a query param.

Editor preview is unaffected; it resolves params through the editor's own saved preview values.

If a page genuinely needs query-driven content, read the query in a client component with `useSearchParams` — the page stays cached and only that subtree renders per request.

A custom renderer that calls `getPage` directly should switch to `loadPublishedPage` from `@pantheon-systems/p1-next-sdk/server` and branch on its `status`, rather than treating a `null` return as both "missing" and "backend down".
