# @pantheon-systems/css-client

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e937842: `@pantheon-systems/css-client`: `documents.create()` accepts an optional `snapshot`, written as the initial version in the same call instead of requiring a separate `versions.create()` round-trip. Purely additive — omitted by every existing caller, unchanged behavior for them.

  `@pantheon-systems/puck-css`: adds `syncComponentRegistryWriteOnly` to the `./registry-sync` subpath export — a CI-only counterpart to `syncComponentRegistry` for a `write:registry`-scoped token with no read access at all. Always creates-or-versions every descriptor + the registry index unconditionally, with no existence/hash-check reads, relying on the backend treating `_registry/*` document creation as idempotent. `syncComponentRegistry` itself is unchanged and keeps its skip-if-unchanged behavior for the interactive editor.

## 0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bc7982: Template types and the template editor now use the content snapshot shape: a `Template` carries `content` items plus `root.props._template` metadata and `root.props._pinMap` pin state, mirroring a Puck document. `templates.list()` returns `TemplateSummary[]` (metadata only, no layout content); fetch a template by ID for its full snapshot. Template layout is authored on the editor canvas and saved through document versions; `templates.create()` and `templates.update()` now accept metadata fields only (label, description, defaultUrlPattern, deprecated). This requires a backend running the matching template API (PCC-3357). Older 0.4.x clients keep working against the updated backend through a temporary compatibility window that also serves derived legacy fields (a top-level label and a components array). The client also reviews and resolves migration conflicts via `migrationConflicts.list()` and `migrationConflicts.resolve()`.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix editing the root "/" homepage from the editor page switcher: selecting the homepage now opens the editor instead of navigating to the dashboard, and all pages route through a single `/p1/` separator via `editorPathHref` (also fixing non-root page links).

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Bug fixes and improvements: deferred branch detection for read:published tokens, init promise retry, production backend URL handling, editor top menu UI improvements.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- dc7cfd7: Fix packages being published with unresolved workspace:\* references by switching from npm publish to pnpm publish. Fix starter kit CLI to show "npm run dev" instead of "npm dev" for npm users.
