Scaffolded sites' `body { margin: 0; }` reset in `app/styles.css` is now scoped via `body:has(> .p1-app-shell)` (with the matching wrapper added around `{children}` in `app/layout.tsx`) instead of a bare `body` selector. Puck's canvas-preview iframe copies every parent stylesheet verbatim and also syncs the host document's `<body>` attributes onto its own iframe `<body>`, so a bare or class-scoped `body` rule here could still match inside the iframe and override its design-token-based body styling (PCC-3499).
