# @pantheon-systems/create-p1-starter-kit

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b746d8: Add non-interactive scaffolding: `--yes`/`-y` accepts defaults for every prompt, and
  `--pm <pnpm|npm|yarn>`, `--git`/`--no-git`, `--install`/`--no-install` answer individual
  prompts directly. CI uses this to scaffold and validate a generated project on every PR.

### Patch Changes

- 61cb80e: **[Fix]** Public package builds no longer ship internal Jira ticket references, expanded internal service names, or backend implementation details (storage engine, compute primitive, real hostnames) in comments, JSDoc, `package.json` descriptions, or READMEs.

  ### What Changed
  - `css-client`, `p1-next-sdk`, `puck-css`, `p1-ai-chat`, and `p1-content-validator` now build in two `tsc` passes — one declarations-only, one comment-stripped `.js` — so implementation comments no longer survive into the published `.js`. JSDoc on exported symbols (which intentionally survives, for consumers' IDE tooltips) was hand-edited to drop internal ticket refs and backend rationale.
  - `p1-media`'s esbuild sourcemaps no longer inline `sourcesContent`; they previously shipped the entire original TypeScript source, comments included, regardless of any `.js`/`.d.ts` cleanup.
  - `puck-css`'s `files` allowlist no longer includes the bare `src/pds/theme` directory, which was shipping a raw test file and a 200KB generated `.ts` source file alongside the intended theme CSS (already covered by the existing `src/**/*.css` entry).
  - `create-p1-starter-kit`'s scaffolded template (copied from `apps/p1-starter`) had the same class of ticket-ref comments cleaned, including its example CI workflow.
  - Package `description` fields and `README.md` files (which npm always publishes regardless of the `files` field) no longer name the internal "CCR"/"Collaborative Content Repository" service.
  - `puck-css`'s `[ccr-store]` log tag and an internal Puck remount key are renamed (`[p1-store]` / `p1-<role>`); neither is persisted or part of any public contract.
  - A new CI guardrail (`.github/scripts/check-npm-leaks.sh`, wired into PR CI's hard gates and into `publish.yml`) packs each public package the way `npm publish` would and fails the build if any of these terms reappear. It fails closed — an unreadable tarball or a glob-free `files` entry whose build output is missing is an error, never a pass — and carries a `--self-test` mode, run first in both workflows, that verifies detection against fixtures.

  No public API or runtime behavior change.

  ### Deliberately out of scope
  - The bare `CCR` service name is deliberately still present in published output — most visibly `puck-css`'s exported `PRODUCTION_BASE_URL` (`https://ccr.p1.pantheon.io`, also referenced in `apps/p1-starter/.env.example`), the live default hostname every unconfigured consumer's SDK talks to, and ~200 local `ccr` variable bindings from `useP1Puck()`. Naming a service is not the leak this fix is about: the guardrail bans the architecture behind it — the expanded "Collaborative Content Repository"/"Collaborative State System" forms, storage engine, CRDT, compute primitive, ticket refs, and `.workers.dev` hostnames. Renaming those bindings is optional cleanup, not a release blocker.

- 859287e: Fix four defects in the generated template:

  - The scaffolded `eslint.config.js` now includes the shared `tests` preset, so test files get
    the test-file rule relaxations instead of being linted as source. The preset list is read from
    the starter app's own config, and the build fails loudly if a preset cannot be inlined.
  - Scaffolded projects ship a working `.gitignore`. npm strips files named `.gitignore` from
    published tarballs, so the template now carries it undotted and the CLI restores the name
    before the initial commit — previously the first commit could include `node_modules` and `.env`.
  - Scaffolds ship a README written for them, and no longer ship the monorepo's `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Scaffolds no longer ship `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` or `next-env.d.ts`. Both are generated
    build artifacts, gitignored in the source app; the tsbuildinfo was a 466KB incremental
    cache keyed to paths inside the monorepo that produced it.

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 59d8607: Fix the Tailwind `@source` path in the starter template so scaffolded projects pick up puck-css component styles. The path was monorepo-relative and did not exist in a scaffold, so every Tailwind utility used inside puck-css (data-list built-in components, editor chrome) rendered unstyled. It now points at `node_modules/@pantheon-systems/puck-css/dist`, which resolves in both the monorepo and a scaffolded project.
- 9bbb083: Stamp `p1.templateVersion` into a scaffolded project's `package.json`, recording the version of `create-p1-starter-kit` that generated it. Previously a scaffold carried no record of its origin, so the only way to infer its generation was reading the pinned dependency versions. The field is the anchor future migration tooling needs to know a project's starting point.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- a16d921: Set `license` to `UNLICENSED` to match the rest of the suite. These packages had drifted
  to `MIT` (or had no `license` field at all), but they are closed-source and were never
  intended to be published under an open-source license.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- f55ce53: **[Fix]** Published pages are now cached instead of server-rendered on every request.

  ### What Changed

  Both public routes shipped with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, which disables the response cache and forces a full server render — and a round trip to the content API — for every visitor, on content that is identical for all of them. The catch-all route additionally read `searchParams`, which opts a route out of caching permanently on its own.

  Published pages no longer read the request query string, and the catch-all declares `generateStaticParams`, so responses now carry `s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate` and are cacheable by a CDN.

  `loadRemoteDatasourceContext` now accepts `searchParams` as optional.

  **A path with no published page is now a real 404.** It previously rendered the "this page doesn't exist yet" screen with a 200 status, which was harmless while every response was uncacheable. Now that the route is statically renderable, a 200 there means every URL a crawler probes becomes a cached response and an indexable page. The screen itself is unchanged — it moved to `app/not-found.tsx`, so it renders from the not-found boundary with a 404 status. A backend outage is deliberately _not_ a 404: it renders a separate, uncacheable holding page, because 404ing live content over a transient blip would deindex it.

  **Reads of published content moved into `@pantheon-systems/p1-next-sdk/server`** as `loadPublishedPage` and `loadRouteTemplateKeys`. They carry invariants that are easy to break by accident in a forked app — initialization awaited per read, misses distinguished from outages, prerendering aborted rather than baking an empty page into the build, and both reads memoized with React `cache()` so `generateMetadata` and the page body share one fetch instead of hitting Postgres twice. How a miss is _presented_ stays in the app.

  Initialization is likewise no longer pinned to a module-level promise in `createP1Handler` and `createP1Pages`. `ensureInitialized` clears its state on failure precisely so the next caller retries; awaiting a stored promise defeated that, so one transient failure at cold start left every later request awaiting a permanently rejected promise.

  **Publishing a route template now invalidates the public catch-all segment.** Instance URLs that resolve by template fall-through alone (`/jedi/5` against `/jedi/:id`) have no store entry, so they cannot be enumerated and were never revalidated — they served pre-edit content until `revalidate` expired. `createP1Handler` accepts `publicPageSegment` for an app whose catch-all is not `[...puckPath]`.

  ### Caching and publish visibility

  `revalidatePath` clears the Next.js response cache, so with no CDN in front an edit appears immediately — that invalidation was previously dead code, since there was never a cached response to invalidate. Behind a CDN that honors the advertised `s-maxage=300`, a publish takes up to 300s (plus `stale-while-revalidate`) to become visible, because nothing in this flow purges the CDN. Adding a purge hook to the publish path is what would close that window.

  ### Migration / Action Required

  The `?param=` **query override** no longer applies to published pages. Route template params are unaffected — they come from the path, so `/products/hats` still resolves `{{ urlParams.slug }}` as before. Only overriding that value with `?slug=…` stops working, along with any datasource driven purely by a query param.

  Editor preview is unaffected; it resolves params through the editor's own saved preview values.

  If a page genuinely needs query-driven content, read the query in a client component with `useSearchParams` — the page stays cached and only that subtree renders per request.

  A custom renderer that calls `getPage` directly should switch to `loadPublishedPage` from `@pantheon-systems/p1-next-sdk/server` and branch on its `status`, rather than treating a `null` return as both "missing" and "backend down".

### Patch Changes

- 863bff6: **[Fix]** Block images now lazy-load by default, so image-heavy pages stop fetching every image regardless of viewport.

  ### What Changed
  - `MediaImage` and `MediaFigure` render `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` unless the caller passes `loading`, so custom blocks built on them inherit the behavior.
  - `createMediaFigureBlock` gained a "Loading" field (Lazy/Eager) whose default comes from the new `defaultLoading` option.
  - The data-list block's Cards/Rows/Listing layouts lazy-load item images, with a new "Image loading" field to opt an instance into eager.
  - The starter's primitive Image block gained the same Lazy/Eager field.

  ### Migration / Action Required

  Lazy loading applies retroactively: existing documents pick it up without being re-saved, so a published page whose LCP element is a hero or first-row listing image will load that image lazily after upgrading, and its LCP may regress until an editor opts back in. Set the block's loading field to "Eager" on above-the-fold images to restore the previous behavior.

- 079216a: **[Fix]** A newly scaffolded project now installs — `pnpm install` previously failed with `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND` before you could run anything.

  ### What Changed

  `@pantheon-systems/p1-ai-chat` and `@pantheon-systems/p1-media` were written into the generated `package.json` with an internal specifier that only resolves inside our own repository. Both are now ordinary version ranges, like every other dependency.

  ### Migration / Action Required

  Scaffold again with this release. A project generated by an earlier version cannot install as-is.

## 0.10.0

### Patch Changes

- e8a472a: Adds the DataListBlock ("List") view-system component: a datasource-driven Puck block that renders a collection in three modes — Grid (cards), Table (rows), and List (listing). Modes come from a registry (`builtin-modes.ts`) mapping each mode key to its layout component, image positions, mode-specific fields, and defaults, so a new mode can be added without touching the block itself. `createDataListBlock()` is exported for apps to instantiate with their own wrapper class.

  When a datasource is selected but field mappings are empty, `autoMapFields()` heuristically assigns datasource fields to the title, subtitle, teaser, image, and icon roles by name pattern, so a freshly dropped block renders real content instead of blanks.

  Adds collection operators (sort, filter, group-by, start-at, max-items, and conditional status filtering for CMS template datasources), applied in the block's `resolveData`.

  Sidebar fields are grouped into collapsible "Content" and "Layout & style" sections via `DataListFieldsGrouper`, which also hides fields belonging to inactive view modes. Puck's built-in field types are replaced throughout with PDS field wrappers (datasource-select, schema-select, template-select, view-mode, image-position) for consistent styling.

  `css-client` gains the query fields and types the block needs to read collection content; `p1-next-sdk` middleware and query fetchers pass them through. The starter-kit template build script now carries the new block's files.

- 74dda98: Adds a README to every published package. Each one rendered a blank page on npmjs.com, because
  no `README.md` existed in the package directory to be included in the tarball — npm renders the
  README from the published tarball, not from the source repository, so a private repo was never
  the cause.

  Also repoints every `repository` URL at `pantheon-systems/p1-platform` with the correct
  `directory`. They still referenced the pre-merge repositories (`puck-css-integration`,
  `collaborative-state-system`, `p1-media-r2`), so the "Repository" link on each npm page went
  nowhere. Adds a matching `homepage` for each package.

  No runtime code changes.

- abc522c: The starter's catch-all route now treats `_redirects/*` as an internal document namespace alongside `_registry/*`, so redirect records can never render as pages.

  Redirect records moved out of `_registry/`, which merge and checkpoint capture treat as code-owned and strip unconditionally — a redirect created on a workstream could never reach the main branch a live site resolves redirects against.

## 0.9.0

### Patch Changes

- 84907a1: Scaffolded sites' `body { margin: 0; }` reset in `app/styles.css` is now scoped via `body:has(> .p1-app-shell)` (with the matching wrapper added around `{children}` in `app/layout.tsx`) instead of a bare `body` selector. Puck's canvas-preview iframe copies every parent stylesheet verbatim and also syncs the host document's `<body>` attributes onto its own iframe `<body>`, so a bare or class-scoped `body` rule here could still match inside the iframe and override its design-token-based body styling (PCC-3499).

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 5075a8a: Sites scaffolded via `create-p1-starter-kit` now include the `@pantheon-systems/p1-media` plugin by default, alongside the existing plain-URL `ImageBlock`. A new `MediaFigureBlock` component adds a real versioned media library and asset picker (metadata, alt text, cropping) to the "Media" category. The plugin is on by default with no feature flag; `siteId`/auth resolve automatically from the ambient P1 editor context. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE_URL` to override the CDN origin used for URL validation in non-production deployments (defaults to the production origin).

### Patch Changes

- Minimum supported Node.js is now 24. The `engines.node` field on these packages moved from `>=18.0.0`/`>=20.12.0` to `>=24.0.0`, so installs on older Node will warn (or fail, depending on your package manager's `engine-strict` setting).
- `ParagraphBlock` in the scaffolded template now uses `richtextField` from `@pantheon-systems/puck-css/fields` instead of a textarea plus ReactMarkdown, enabling inline canvas editing, TipTap-backed rich text, AI generation hints, and the shared Bold/Italic/Underline/BulletList/OrderedList menu with no per-block configuration. Because the richtext field stores HTML rather than markdown, the render path sanitizes it through a shared SSR-safe sanitizer (allowlisting inline formatting, lists, and safe-protocol links) before it reaches `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. The template also registers `@tailwindcss/typography` so `prose` list markers render under Tailwind v4 Preflight.

## 0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 986075f: Add the LaunchDarkly-gated `p1-chatbot` AI assistant to the starter-kit editor. The chatbot renders only when the `p1-chatbot` LaunchDarkly flag is enabled and an agent URL is configured, so scaffolded sites ship with it off by default until opted in.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- efb961d: Fix the starter kit's auth route forcing Google's full re-authentication screen on every login (`prompt: 'login'`), even with a live browser session. Sites scaffolded via `create-p1-starter-kit` now use `prompt: 'select_account'`, so an existing Google session is reused with a lightweight account-chooser step instead of forcing full re-auth, while still letting users switch accounts on logout/login.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix editing the root "/" homepage from the editor page switcher: selecting the homepage now opens the editor instead of navigating to the dashboard, and all pages route through a single `/p1/` separator via `editorPathHref` (also fixing non-root page links).

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Bug fixes and improvements: deferred branch detection for read:published tokens, init promise retry, production backend URL handling, editor top menu UI improvements.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- dc7cfd7: Fix packages being published with unresolved workspace:\* references by switching from npm publish to pnpm publish. Fix starter kit CLI to show "npm run dev" instead of "npm dev" for npm users.
